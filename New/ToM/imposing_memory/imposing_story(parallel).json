James: Yeah I'm gradually finding my way around, thanks. Hey, you don't happen to know where I can find the nearest store to buy some post stamps? I need to send a card to my granny. Lisa: Oh, that's sweet of you. James: Yeah but it’s her birthday tomorrow and I can't see her myself, so I'm kind of worried that it’s not going to get there on time. So I really need to send it today but I don't know where to find a store nearby. Lisa: Uhm, I think there is one on Chestnut Street, so if you go down to the end of this street and turn left, then it's about half a block down on the left. James: Thanks! Lisa: No problem.

James: Oh, I'm just a bit annoyed. I was really hoping to send a card to my granny, so I was looking for a store where they would sell post stamps. So I asked Lisa, you know her, right? She is in our class. Pete: Yeah, I know Lisa! James: Well, I asked Lisa where I could buy post stamps. She told me there was a store on Chestnut Street. But when I got there, there was a big sign on the door saying it had moved to Bold Street. So I raced over to Bold Street, but I didn't make it on time, the store was already closed. Pete: No way! James: Yeah. So now my granny won't get her birthday card on time and I know she'll be really disappointed. James: Hey, I've heard that Lisa is a bit of a joker. Do you think she would send me to the wrong place on purpose? Pete: Well, did she know how important it was to send the card today? James: Yeah I told her it was for granny's birthday tomorrow. Pete: Then I think she probably wouldn't have been deliberately trying to trick you. It was probably an honest mistake.\nQuestion: James: I believed Lisa when she told me where the store was.

Sara: So? Emma and Zoe always save seats for each other. Olivia: But Zoe went home sick this morning! So Emma couldn't have been saving the seat for her. She was just making up an excuse. Olivia: I think the real reason that she didn't want me to sit with them is that she's jealous. She thinks her boyfriend Lucas has a crush on me, but it isn't true! Sara: Well, I didn't know that Zoe was off sick. I was in a rehearsal all morning, and actually, Emma was there too, so she probably didn't know either that Zoe had gone home.
