Sam: Yeah I'm gradually finding my way around, thanks. Hey, you don't happen to know where I can find the nearest store to buy some post stamps? I need to send a card to my granny. Helen: Oh, that's sweet of you. Sam: Yeah but it’s her birthday tomorrow and I can't see her myself, so I'm kind of worried that it’s not going to get there on time.

Helen: Uhm, I think there is one on Chestnut Street, so if you go down to the end of this street and turn left, then it's about half a block down on the left. Sam: Thanks! Helen: No problem.

Sam: Oh, I'm just a bit annoyed. I was really hoping to send a card to my granny, so I was looking for a store where they would sell post stamps. So I asked Helen, you know her, right? She is in our class. Pete: Yeah, I know Helen! Sam: Well, I asked Helen where I could buy post stamps. She told me there was a store on Chestnut Street. But when I got there, there was a big sign on the door saying it had moved to Bold Street. So I raced over to Bold Street, but I didn't make it on time, the store was already closed. Pete: No way! Sam: Yeah. So now my granny won't get her birthday card on time and I know she'll be really disappointed. Sam: Hey, I've heard that Helen is a bit of a joker. Do you think she would send me to the wrong place on purpose? Pete: Well, did she know how important it was to send the card today? Sam: Yeah I told her it was for granny's birthday tomorrow. Pete: Then I think she probably wouldn't have been deliberately trying to trick you. It was probably an honest mistake.\nQuestion: Sam: I believed Helen when she told me where the store was.

She is late for the lunch break and when she comes in, all the places are taken. Then, she discovers there is a free chair next to Ama and her boyfriend, Matthias. Hannah: Hi guys, I'm late, can I sit here? Ama: Oh actually, I was saving that seat for Abi. Hannah: Oh, okay. Ama: Sorry! Hannah meets Carolyn. Hannah: Hey Carolyn, can I sit here? Carolyn: Sure. Carolyn: Hey are you OK? You look a bit upset. Hannah: Yeah I'm alright, it's just that Ama is so mean sometimes. Carolyn: What happened? Hannah: Well, I came in to lunch a bit late, and there were hardly any seats left, but when I asked if I could sit at the table with her and Matthias and their friends, Ama said she was saving the seat for Abi! Carolyn: So? Ama and Abi always save seats for each other. Hannah: But Abi went home sick this morning! So Ama couldn't have been saving the seat for her. She was just making up an excuse. Hannah: I think the real reason that she didn't want me to sit with them is that she's jealous. She thinks her boyfriend Matthias has a crush on me, but it isn't true! Carolyn: Well, I didn't know that Abi was off sick. I was in a rehearsal all morning, and actually, Ama was there too, so she probably didn't know either that Abi had gone home. Carolyn: Besides, we sat with her and Matthias at lunch yesterday and that didn't bother her. So I don't think she's jealous of you.\nQuestion: Hannah: I didn't believe that Matthias (Ama's boyfriend) really liked me. I wanted Carolyn to know that. Is this correct?",
